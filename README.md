##  Project Summary  
Predicted short-term stock price movements (up/down trends) using daily financial news headlines by combining natural language processing and machine learning techniques.  
Applied FinBERT and XGBoost to model sentiment-driven stock fluctuations across FAANG stocks—leveraging real-world financial datasets during the AI4ALL Ignite accelerator.

##  Problem Statement  
As real-time financial headlines increasingly drive market sentiment, investors—especially retail traders—lack tools to systematically interpret this impact.  
This project investigates whether news sentiment and keyword patterns can accurately predict short-term stock price directions for major tech companies (FAANG), enhancing data-driven decision-making.

---

##  Key Results  
- 📰 Processed 10,000+ headlines and aligned them with FAANG stock movements  
- 🔍 Identified key biases in financial news (sentiment ambiguity, lag effects, non-financial influences)  
- 📈 Achieved over **70% test accuracy** using XGBoost for binary classification (PriceUp = 1/-1)  
- 📊 Created real-time, user-friendly prediction interface with Streamlit deployment

---

## ⚙ Methodologies  
- **FinBERT Sentiment Extraction**: Used a pre-trained financial transformer model to assign sentiment scores to each headline (positive, neutral, negative).  
- **XGBoost Classification**: Engineered features like keyword frequency and rolling stock returns to classify next-day price direction.  
- **Streamlit App**: Built an interactive web UI for headline input and live prediction using the trained XGBoost model.
